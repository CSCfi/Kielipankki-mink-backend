# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2024-01-05

### Added

- Added new resource type: metadata YAML files. There are now calls for creating, uploading and downloading these.
- It is now possible to upload source files with uppercase file extensions.

### Changed

- The corpus registry and the job queue have been combined. Now, upon resource creation a job item is created immediately
  (instead of it being created first upon starting a Sparv job).
- The `/check-status`-call has been replaced with `/resource-info` with a different response format.
