    # Introduction
    Web API serving as a backend to Min Språkbank.

    # Overview
    For now the API is used for uploading corpus data to a user's Nextcloud
    instance and processing that data with Sparv.

    A user must have a valid [Nextcloud account](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/nextcloud)
    at Språkbanken Text. Before any data can be uploaded, Min Språkbank must be initialized
    (see <a href="#operation/initMinSB">init Min SB</a>).

    # Workflow
    A workflow for processing data with Sparv via Min Språkbank could look like this:
    
    1. <a href="#operation/initMinSB">Initialize Min Språkbank</a> (only once per user)
    2. <a href="#operation/uploadcorpus">Upload some corpus files</a>
    3. <a href="#operation/uploadconfig">Upload a corpus config file</a>
    4. <a href="#operation/runSparv">Run Sparv</a>
    5. <a href="#operation/checkstatus">Check the status</a>
    6. <a href="#operation/downloadexports">Download export files</a>

    Please note that the user needs to make a `/check-status` call after the annotation process in order
    for the export files to be synced to Nextcloud. This is due to authentication restrictions. Once the annotation
    process with Sparv is complete and a `/check-status` call is made, the export files will by synced automatically.
